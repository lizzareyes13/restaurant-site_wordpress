I am often asked how people can support my work. It is very
time consuming to create such quality video content only to
give it away for free. On my website I have a Recommended page:
http://www.wpcrafter.com/recommended/

When you purchase any products or services from that page, I
will earn a modest commission. Helps keep the lights on :)

For support, please leave a comment on the post that this 
website challenge was on. I will be happy to help you!!!

Once again, thank you for your trust in me, and I can’t wait 
to see your website.

Adam @ WPCrafter
