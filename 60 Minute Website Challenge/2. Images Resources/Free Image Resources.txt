One of the most important things in order to have a website 
that stands out, is awesome images. Here are the websites I 
go to for free images:

I am often asked how people can support my work. It is very
time consuming to create such quality video content only to
give it away for free. On my website I have a Recommended page:
http://www.wpcrafter.com/recommended/

When you purchase any products or services from that page, I
will earn a modest commission. Helps keep the lights on :)

Once again, thank you for your trust in me, and I can’t wait 
to see your website.
